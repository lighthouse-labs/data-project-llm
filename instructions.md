# LLM Project Assignment

Welcome to your LLM course project! This file will guide you through the first steps and help you organize your work.

## Choose Your Project

Select one project idea to work on throughout this course:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Tool**: Analyze emotions or opinions in text data.

2. **Document Summarization Tool**: Summarize long documents into shorter, easier-to-read versions.

3. **Topic Modeling**: Automatically find common themes or topics in large collections of text.

After choosing your project type, decide on a specific theme or focus. For example, analyze sentiment in movie reviews, summarize legal documents, or find topics in customer feedback. If youâ€™re unsure what to pick, ask your instructor or classmates for ideas.

> **Note:** You do not need to find your own dataset. The course will provide datasets that fit your project later.

## Keep a Project Journal (Optional but Recommended)

Keeping a project journal helps you track ideas, questions, progress, and resources. This can be a simple Google Doc, a GitHub page, or any note-taking tool you prefer.

Use your journal to:

- Record your project ideas and any changes  
- Save useful links and research  
- Note feedback from mentors or peers  
- Track your progress and challenges

This journal will be helpful when you prepare your final project presentation.

## Next Steps

You will soon participate in a brainstorming session to expand your project ideas. Be ready to share your chosen project and theme.
